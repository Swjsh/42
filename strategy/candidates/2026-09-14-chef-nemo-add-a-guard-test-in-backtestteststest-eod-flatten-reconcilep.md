# CANDIDATE: add-a-guard-test-in-backtestteststest-eod-flatten-reconcilep

**Filed:** 2026-09-14
**Filer:** kitchen-daemon (Stage-1-gated cook, GOAL-KITCHEN-RUNNER-IN-LOOP-2026-09-05)
**Status:** DRAFT (RUNNER-FAILED -- NEEDS-RATIFICATION per Rule 9)

## Hypothesis

Add a guard test in backtest/tests/test_eod_flatten_reconcile.py that asserts both eod-flatten.py and eod-flatten-aggressive.py scan pnl-statement.json for unrecorded fills and append RECONCILE_FILL rows to their respective CSVs; include a test case with known unjournaled fill to verify behavior.

## Provenance

provenance: C:\Users\jackw\Desktop\42\backtest\.venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\jackw\Desktop\42\setup\scripts\kitchen_stage1_runner.py --combo-json {} --slug add-a-guard-test-in-backtestteststest-eod-flatten-reconcilep --task-id 37d4278f-c680-4dd1-88fa-fe4cad78a227 --timeout-s 480.0 -> RUNNER-FAILED (single_worker_lock_held -- another Stage-1 run is in flight)
status: RUNNER-FAILED (single_worker_lock_held -- another Stage-1 run is in flight)
engine_note: MECHANISM EVIDENCE ONLY -- BS-synthetic option pricing over historical SPY/VIX bars (backtest.autoresearch.overnight_grinder.evaluate_combo -> lib.pricing.black_scholes). NOT real-fills evidence. Per memory project_free_kitchen_plan_b_hardened.md.

NO NUMBERS ARE PRESENT IN THIS FILE. Per GOAL-KITCHEN-RUNNER-IN-LOOP-2026-09-05 a verdict or numeric claim cannot be written unless the Stage-1 runner executed successfully and produced an artifact. Cross-check: automation/state/kitchen-stage1-run-log.jsonl.

## Pre-merge gate

N/A -- runner failed, no evidence exists to gate on. Re-enqueue after the failure is understood (see reason above); do not hand-write numbers in to unblock this.

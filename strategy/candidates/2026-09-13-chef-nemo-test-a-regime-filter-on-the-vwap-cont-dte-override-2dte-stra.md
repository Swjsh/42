# CANDIDATE: test-a-regime-filter-on-the-vwap-cont-dte-override-2dte-stra

**Filed:** 2026-09-13
**Filer:** kitchen-daemon (Stage-1-gated cook, GOAL-KITCHEN-RUNNER-IN-LOOP-2026-09-05)
**Status:** DRAFT (RUNNER-FAILED -- NEEDS-RATIFICATION per Rule 9)

## Hypothesis

Test a regime filter on the VWAP_CONT_DTE_OVERRIDE_2DTE strategy to exclude the losing quarters (2025Q3 and 2026Q2) and measure if the edge becomes regime-robust across the remaining windows.

## Provenance

provenance: C:\Users\jackw\Desktop\42\backtest\.venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\jackw\Desktop\42\setup\scripts\kitchen_stage1_runner.py --combo-json {} --slug test-a-regime-filter-on-the-vwap-cont-dte-override-2dte-stra --task-id 30a2eca5-e241-4336-bb7f-71d28db49f05 --timeout-s 480.0 -> RUNNER-FAILED (single_worker_lock_held -- another Stage-1 run is in flight)
status: RUNNER-FAILED (single_worker_lock_held -- another Stage-1 run is in flight)
engine_note: MECHANISM EVIDENCE ONLY -- BS-synthetic option pricing over historical SPY/VIX bars (backtest.autoresearch.overnight_grinder.evaluate_combo -> lib.pricing.black_scholes). NOT real-fills evidence. Per memory project_free_kitchen_plan_b_hardened.md.

NO NUMBERS ARE PRESENT IN THIS FILE. Per GOAL-KITCHEN-RUNNER-IN-LOOP-2026-09-05 a verdict or numeric claim cannot be written unless the Stage-1 runner executed successfully and produced an artifact. Cross-check: automation/state/kitchen-stage1-run-log.jsonl.

## Pre-merge gate

N/A -- runner failed, no evidence exists to gate on. Re-enqueue after the failure is understood (see reason above); do not hand-write numbers in to unblock this.
